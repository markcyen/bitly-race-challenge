## Project Description

bit.ly Back End Code Challenge

This challenge is an opportunity to illustrate how I would break down product requirements into actual code, as well as demostrate code quality and style. The challenge is located in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/tlugger/da0c60d5276934070b7d017b947d8464).

## Language

This challenge was accomplished in Ruby (version 2.7.2). Ruby versions can be downloaded from [online](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/10/02/ruby-2-7-2-released/). I believe you can use Ruby versions 2.5.3 and above, but kindly let me know if you have any issues. You can also brew install ruby on your Mac (sorry, I am not sure about Windows) by typing in `brew install ruby@2.7`. Here is the [link](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ruby@2.7) to the instructions. 

## Instructions

Once you have this file in your computer, there are a few gems (or libraries) in the Gemfile. In your terminal, type in `bundle install` to bundle the gem packages. 

## Dependencies

For your refences, here are a list of gems used in this challenge.
- `gem 'awesome_print'`: for allowing the ruby language to shine when debugging
- `gem 'bundler'`: to bundle the gem packages for this program
- `gem 'pry'`: a debugging tool
- `gem 'pry-byebug'`: to add some navigation capabilities via binding.pry
- `gem 'rspec'`: to allow for testing

## Testing

You can run the test by typing `rspec` or `bundle exec rspec` into your terminal. You should be able to see how many passed as well as any failures (which there should be none!).

## Running the program

In the terminal, type in `ruby run_program.rb` and that should start the code challenge. There will be a series of prompts for you to answer in order for the program to run its course. By the end, you should get the result of a rounded average of the sail times as well as a list of the boats finish times.

## Note from the Author

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this code challenge. I had a great time working on this and thought some parts of it was challenging. I attempted to cover all my bases with edge cases.
